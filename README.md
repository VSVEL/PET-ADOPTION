The dataset consists of parameters such as: a unique ID assigned to each animal that is up for adoption, date on which they arrived at the shelter, their physical attributes such as color, length and height, among other factors.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

I have appleid Machine Learning skills to build models that classify images into multiple categories
This challenge has enhanced my knowledge of multi-label classification. It is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning
